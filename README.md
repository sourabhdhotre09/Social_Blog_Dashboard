# Social Media Posts Management Dashboard

A Social Media Post Management Dashboard built with React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. The application simulates backend functionality with local state using Redux Toolkit or a mock API to handle CRUD operations for posts, likes, comments, and search functionality .

## Features

### 1. Post Management:
- **Display Posts**: Shows a list of posts with text-content.
- **Add Post**: Allows users to add new posts containing only text.
- **Edit Post**: Users can edit the text of existing posts.
- **Delete Post**: Enables users to delete posts with a confirmation prompt.

### 2. Like and Comment Functionality:
- **Like Post**: Add a like button for each post to track likes.
- **Comment on Post**: Users can add comments to posts.
- **Nested Comments**: Supports one level of nested comments (comments on posts, but no replies to comments).
- **Edit Comment**: Allows users to edit their comments.
- **Delete Comment**: Enables users to delete comments with a confirmation prompt.

### 3. Search Functionality:
- **Search Bar**: A search bar in the navigation bar allows users to search for text within both posts and comments.
- **Search Results**: Dynamically displays matching posts and comments based on the search query.

### 4. Navigation Bar:
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a navigation bar with a search bar and basic navigation links.

### 5. State Management:
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages the global state for posts, comments, likes, and search functionality.

### 6. UI Considerations:
- The styling is done using **Tailwind CSS**, with optional usage of **Material UI** for basic layout and components.
